## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

Learning a lot about CSS Grid. Also tried BEM again, and don't feel comfortable using it yet, but I really want to learn more about the methodology.

### Continued development

If possible, I would really aprecciate some feedback on my CSS class naming using BEM. 

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://getbem.com) - BEM CSS methodology documentation I used.
